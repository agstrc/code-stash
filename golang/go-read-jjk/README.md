# go-jjk
This simple Go program checks for new releases of the Jujutsu Kaisen manga and sends Discord messages via webhooks
whenever a new chapter is available.  
I created this because I honestly always forget released dates. Currently, I am periodically running this via cronjob
on a remote server.
