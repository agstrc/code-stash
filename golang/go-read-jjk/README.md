# go-jjk
I created this simple Go program to notify me about new chapters of the Jujutsu Kaisen manga. Yes, I am away that there
are easier ways to do this than what I've done, but this was mostly for fun and practice.
The notification is sent via a Discord webhook which is read from a configuration file.
